In this temperature converter, we created a straightforward interface with four main parts. The first is a numeric input for temperature entry. The second is a dropdown for choosing Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. The third is a "Convert" button to trigger the conversion. The JavaScript function, convertTemperature(), manages the logic and displays the result in the fourth elementâ€”an area labeled "Converted Temperature." The code includes input validation for numeric values. We added Kelvin conversion for an extra challenge. The design emphasizes simplicity, offering an easy-to-use tool for swift temperature conversions.
